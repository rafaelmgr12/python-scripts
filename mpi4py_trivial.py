#Suppose you have a collection of tasks, which in this example I'll assume is just running a function f.
#If these tasks are completely separate and independent the most then you can parallelize them easily.
#In this gist I'll show the simplest possible way to do this using mpi4py.
#There are better ways to do this, in particular if the tasks vary significantly in time taken to run.

  #open file with name based on task number

#And now moving on the parallel version
  
#mpi4py has the notion of a "communicator" - a collection of processors
#all operating together, usually on the same program.  Each processor 
#in the communicator is identified by a number, its rank,  We'll use that
#number to split the tasks

#find out which number processor this particular instance is,
#and how many there are in total
rank = mpi4py.MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_rank()

#parallelized version
#the enumerate function gives us a number i in addition
#to the task.  (In this specific case i is the same as task!  But that's
#not true usually)
for i,task in enumerate(task_list):
  #This is how we split up the jobs.
  #The % sign is a modulus, and the "continue" means
  #"skip the rest of this bit and go to the next time
  #through the loop"
  # If we had e.g. 4 processors, this would mean
  # that proc zero did tasks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, ...
  # and proc one did tasks 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, ...
  # and do on.
